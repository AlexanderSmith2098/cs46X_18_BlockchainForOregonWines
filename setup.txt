Open up a terminal (make sure you're in the root directory of the project) and type:
docker volume create sawtoothMongo
Then (make sure you're in the root directory of the project), type in:
docker-compose up --build -d
This creates containers for a single node, the transaction processor, and a mongodb.

If you need to work on the transaction processor, and you only want to containerize mongodb and the node, change the name of docker-compose.yaml
to something else (like docker-composeDEV.yaml).  Then remove the Dev1 from docker-composeDev1.yaml.  THEN open up index.js in the processor folder 
and follow the instructions in the comments.  It is necessary to run the transaction processor locally through the terminal (just type node index.js
in the processor folder) if you do this.

When you are finished coding/developing/whatever, simply type docker-down (it doesn't matter where your terminal is currently at).

Whenever you want to start everything up again, simply type:
docker-compose up -d
into a terminal.  Both the UP and DOWN commands will work as long as you're in the directory (or a child directory) that contains the docker-compose.yaml
